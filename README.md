# Verilog-Collective
Generic Verilog code templates for digital design.

I've created this repository because:

1) Reusable code, so no need to write everything from scratch each time.
2) Open learning resource for myself and anyone interested in digital design.

I'll keep adding more throughout my learning journey!
